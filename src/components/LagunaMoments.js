                        <p>Added to the circuit in 1957, this corner is famous in the motorsports world for its blind crest and sudden drop. This corner has been the site of many dramatic racing moments. In 1996, Alex Zanardi made a daring pass on Bryan Herta at the famous Corkscrew turn during the final lap of the CART race. This move is often referred to as "The Pass" and is considered one of the greatest overtakes in motorsport history.</p>

                        <p>The designation of Turn 9 as "Rainey Curve" marks a significant moment in Laguna Seca's history. This tribute honors Wayne Rainey, a three-time 500cc World Champion whose career ended prematurely due to an accident in 1993. The naming not only commemorates Rainey's exceptional achievements but also symbolizes the track's deep connection to motorsport legacy and its champions.</p>
